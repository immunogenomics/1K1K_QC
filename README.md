The cells-by-features table described in Supplementary Text 2 (included in this repo as "OneK1K_Doublet_Removal_Report.pdf”) 
and indexed by cell barcode is available here as “cell_meta.csv.” This table can be used for filtering cells from the published
OneK1K dataset to achieve the same QC described here.
